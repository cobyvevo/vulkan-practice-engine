this is one of the first projects ive made using the Vulkan graphics API + vulkan C++ header
this is all heavily based on vulkan-tutorial and vkguide, but changed in some ways due to the c++ header being so cool

NOTE: this being one of my first vulkan projects, this code is a mess. this is just because i want to mess around with the vulkan API in my own way. trial and error is the best way for me to learn stuff personally
